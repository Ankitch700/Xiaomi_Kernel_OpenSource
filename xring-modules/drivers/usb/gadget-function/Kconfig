	   Microsoft Windows XP bundles the "Remote NDIS" (RNDIS) protocol,
	   and Microsoft provides redistributable binary RNDIS drivers for
	   older versions of Windows.

	   To make MS-Windows work with this, use Documentation/usb/linux.inf
	   as the "driver info file".  For versions of MS-Windows older than
	   XP, you'll need to download drivers from Microsoft's website; a URL
	   is given in comments found in that info file.
