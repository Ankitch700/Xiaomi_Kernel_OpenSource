-- BUILD --

You need a fully configured kernel source tree in order to build the
driver. Please set the location of the kernel tree in the Makefile (KDIR).
If you want some extra debug information in the kernel logs, you could
define the HANTRO_DRIVER_DEBUG but please be aware that allot of things are traced
with this option.
Also you could set a particular device MAJOR in the 'vcx_normal_driver.c' and 'vcx_vcmd_driver.c' 
if you don't want dynamic allocation.

Just run in this dir:

%make

If you want to install the modules please check first the install destination
in the Makefile (MDIR, DEST) and run:

%make install

-- USAGE --

Run script driver_load.sh to do all the things described below.
> sh driver_load.sh vcmd=0

First of all the module has to be inserted into the kernel with:
(you need a Linux shell cmd line)

%insmod vsi_vcx.ko vcmd_supported=1

Second of all a char device file has to be created:

%mknod /dev/vsi_vcx c $MAJOR 0

Replace MAJOR = 254 with the correct value (i.e. read /proc/devices to find out
the exact value).

Make sure that you have RW rights for the newly created dev file (use 'chmod').

The 'driver_load' script is provided for preparing all the things necessary for
the driver to be usable. The script is using 'cat' to retrieve the device's
major from /proc/devices. Remember to set the driver parameters.

-- TIPS --
If you want update vcx_normal_cfg.h and vcx_vcmd_cfg.h according to 
customer:project, please run create_FPGA_H.sh before run 'make', for example:
$ ./create_FPGA_H.sh VSI:DEV
Please confirm whether the base address determined by the platform is correct before make
