	  Say Y here to use i2c-* device files, usually found in the /dev
	  directory on your system.  They make it possible to have user-space
	  programs use the I2C bus.  Information on how to do this is
	  contained in the file <file:Documentation/i2c/dev-interface.rst>.

	  This support is also available as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called i2c-dev.
