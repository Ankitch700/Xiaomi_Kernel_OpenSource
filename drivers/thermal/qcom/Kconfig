	help
	  This enables the thermal sysfs driver for the TSENS device. It shows
	  up in Sysfs as a thermal zone with multiple trip points. Disabling the

	  This enables a thermal sysfs driver for Qualcomm plug-and-play (QPNP)
	  PMIC devices. It shows up in sysfs as a thermal sensor with multiple
	  trip points. The temperature reported by the thermal sensor reflects the
	  real time die temperature if an ADC is present or an estimate of the
	  temperature based upon the over temperature stage value.

	help
	  This enables initialization of Qualcomm limits management
	  hardware(LMh). LMh allows for hardware-enforced mitigation for cpus based on
	  input from temperature and current sensors.  On many newer Qualcomm SoCs
	  LMh is configured in the firmware and this feature need not be enabled.
	  However, on certain SoCs like sdm845 LMh has to be configured from kernel.

	   This enables to list the QTI remote subsystem temperature sensors
	   with QMI TS V2 interface. This driver can read the temperature of
	   the remote sensor. These sensors can take thresholds and notify the
	   thermal framework when the threshold is reached.

	   The QMI cooling device will interface with remote subsystem
	   using QTI QMI interface.

	  voltage sensors with the thermal core framework and can take
	  threshold input and notify the thermal core when the threshold is
	  reached.
